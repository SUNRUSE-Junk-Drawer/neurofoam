## Overview

Neurofoam is an approach for making dead-simple applications which port easily (even to the Web) and have automatic concurrency control.  It is best suited to systems which have many disconnected "islands" of state, which are referred to as "bubbles", where the system as a whole becomes a "foam" of these "bubbles".

It was built for a single private project and is not designed for solving real-world problems.
